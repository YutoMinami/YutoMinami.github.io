This is the first measurement of its kind. We infer a best-fit galaxy bias of , corresponding to a host halo mass of  at an effective redshift of z $\\sim$ 2 from the cross-correlation power spectrum. Residual uncertainties in the redshift distribution of the submillimeter galaxies are subdominant with respect to the statistical precision. We perform a suite of systematic tests, finding that instrumental and astrophysical contaminations are small compared to the statistical error. This cross-correlation measurement only relies on CMB polarization information that, differently from CMB temperature maps, is less contaminated by galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, providing a clearer view of the projected matter distribution. This result demonstrates the feasibility and robustness of this approach for future high-sensitivity CMB polarization experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-correlation of POLARBEAR CMB Polarization Lensing with High-$z$ Sub-mm Herschel-ATLAS galaxies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

By adding new data collected during the second season of observations (2013–2014) to re-analyzed data from the first season (2012–2013), we have reduced twofold the band-power uncertainties. The band powers are reported over angular multipoles ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/848/2/121/apjaa8e9fieqn1.gif] $500łeqslant ell łeqslant 2100$ , where the dominant B -mode signal is expected to be due to the gravitational lensing of E -modes. We reject the null hypothesis of no B -mode polarization at a confidence of 3.1 σ including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We test the consistency of the measured B -modes with the Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) framework by fitting for a single lensing amplitude parameter A L relative to the Planck 2015 best-fit model prediction.
